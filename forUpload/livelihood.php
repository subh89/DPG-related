          <h2><span>Project: Financial Inclusion & Literacy  </span></h2>
          <div class="clr"></div>
          <div class="post_content">
            <p>Financial inclusion is delivery of banking services at an affordable cost (PMJDY accounts) to the vast sections of disadvantaged 
              and low income group. Unrestrained access to public goods and services is the sine qua non of an open and efficient society. 
              As banking services are in the nature of public good, it is essential that availability of banking and payment services 
              to the entire population without discrimination is the prime objective of the public policy."</p>
            <h2 class="star"><span>Objective</span></h2>
            <p>To help disadvantaged communities, unorganized groups, lower income communities to access financial service 
              at an affordable cost and in a most satisfying way.</p>
      <h2 class="star"><span>Problem</span></h2>
            <p>The banking industry has shown tremendous growth in volume and complexity during the last few decades. 
              Despite making significant improvements in all the areas relating to financial viability, profitability and competitiveness, 
              there are concerns that banks have not been able to reach and bring vast segment of the population, especially 
              the underprivileged sections of the society, into the fold of basic banking services. Internationally also efforts are being made 
              to study the causes of financial exclusion and design strategies to ensure financial inclusion of the poor and disadvantaged. 
              The reasons may vary from country to country and so also the strategy but all out efforts are needed as financial inclusion can 
              truly lift the standard of life of the poor and the disadvantaged. </p>
